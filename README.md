## Gameplay
Use **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move around  
Use **E** to morph (provided you have the crystals for it)

If stuck at any point, you can pause using **Esc** and restart from there. ⁿᵒᵒᵇ

## Design
Centering around the theme of *Metamorphosis*, the primary mechanic in the game is to *morph*, consuming a crystal. Once morphed, all objects in the game world exhbit slightly different (and considerably more morbid) behaviour.

The game is primarily a 2D puzzle game, with elements of movement based action. 

Each individual puzzle mechanic is fairly simple, there are buttons that open doors, there are boxes that can be pushed around. In the morphed state, there are monsters that chase you like the ghosts in pacman, there are guardians that shock you if you approach too close.

However, it is the intrucate mix of both these mechanics that make the game unique among other games of this genre, or rather both genres. 

One second, the player might be thinking about how to open a certain door, the next he will be dodging multiple bullets while being chased by 2 morphed "boxes".

It is to be noted that morphing is used both to include high action, high tension sections, as well as to aid in puzzle sections that can't be solved while following the constrains of the unmorphed entities.

## Audio design
Audio is also a key element in making the world feel different when morphed and when not. The music is high paced and tense then morphed, happy and carefree when not. SFX are more worrying when morphed, more mundane when not.

## Development
The project was made in Godot v4.2.1, dotnet version 6+
